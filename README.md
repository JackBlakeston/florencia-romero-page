Business website for a translator.

[Check it out!](https://florenciaromero.com)

The page is fully localized into English and Spanish, and complies with all Spanish and European data protection laws. It is fully responsive on any screen size.

### Tech Stack

- React, set up with Create React App
- Typescript
- react-intl for localization
- react-slick-carousel for portfolio image carousel

### Commands

Install and run:

```bash
npm i
npm start
```

### Adding images to carousel

The carousel is set up so that someone without programming knowledge can add images. All images in the folder src/assets/images/portfolio-items/ will be displayed on the carrousel. Adding a numeric prefix (as seen in the other items in the folder) will position the image in the specified index of the carousel.

### Editing translations

Both translation files can be found in src/translations/

Editing these files directly modifies the strings on the page for the specified locale.

### Business cards

Physical business cards have been printed, and they link directly to the page via a QR code.
