  "app.sections.aboutMe.text": "My name is Florencia, and I am officially a translator since 2013, though my vocation started much earlier. \n\nSince I was a little girl I have been passionate about reading, and back in 2003 I discovered that my favorite book saga was being released in English earlier than in Spanish, so I thought: \"How nice would it be to help people experience these stories in their own language?\". It was then when I fell in love with translation.\n\nWhile I was studying, I translated all kinds of texts and content. The challenges of translating movies and TV shows, the creativity, the play on words, the puns and jokes, the differences between cultures and the nuances of accessibility made me fall in love with audiovisual translation.\n\nWhen I finished University, I studied a Master's Degree (METAV), and I discovered a new passion for localization, specifically for video game localization.\n\nIn addition to all that, my innate perfectionism, my attention to details, and focus on orthography and grammar made me wonder if I might be a good editor and proofreader as well. And, in fact, my first job was as an audiobook editor.\n\nNow I combine all my passions and I enjoy the fact that I work on what I really love and always have a different project to tinker with.",
